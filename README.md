# Dog Image Preprocessing for Deep Learning

This repository contains a basic script for preprocessing dog images to prepare them for deep learning tasks. The preprocessing steps include resizing images to a fixed size and converting them from RGB to grayscale.

## Features:
Image Resizing: Ensures all images are resized to a fixed resolution to maintain consistency in input dimensions.
Grayscale Conversion: Simplifies image data by converting RGB images to grayscale, reducing the complexity of image channels.
Easy Visualization: View the images before and after preprocessing using built-in tools.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
Matplotlib.image: For reading and saving image files seamlessly.
Matplotlib.pyplot: For displaying the images to visualize the transformations applied.
Pillow (PIL): For image manipulation, including resizing and format handling.
OpenCV: For efficient operations such as resizing and RGB-to-Grayscale conversion.
